\subsection{Initial Conditions}

For time-dependent problems Nek5000 allows the user to choose among
the following types of initial conditions for the
velocity, temperature and passive scalars:
\begin{itemize}
\item Zero initial conditions: default; if nothing is specified.
\item Fortran function: This option allows the user to specify the
  initial condition as a fortran function,
  e.g., as a function of \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\).
\item Presolv: For a temperature problem the presolv option gives the
  steady conduction solution as initial condition for the temperature.
  For a fluid problem this option {\em can} give the
  steady Stokes solution as the initial condition for the velocity
  {\em provided} that the classical splitting scheme is {\em not} used.
\item Restart: this option allows the user to read in results from an earlier
  simulation, and use these as initial conditions.
\end{itemize}
A tabulated summary of the compatibility of these initial condition options
with various other solution strategies/parameters is given in the appendix.
