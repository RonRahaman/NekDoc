The code Nek5000 is based on the following design principles
\begin{itemize}
\item accessible both to beginners and experts alike
\item accessible interface via Fortran to include user-defined modules
\item the code intrinsics can be accessed and modified via the user files for more experienced developers
\item portability
\item minimal use of external libraries to assure fast compile times
\item fast matrix free operator evaluation with minimal storage
\item matrix operations are implemented in assembler code \(M\times M\) routines to speed up computations
\item the parallelism is "under the hood" demanding from the user only care in handling local versus global operations and array sizes
\item by testing at the beginning of each run which one of the 3 readily implemented parallel algorithms behaves optimally it can be stated that the parallelism of Nek5000 is automatically tuned to each machine
\item direct access to parameters at runtime
\item geometry and boundary conditions exposed to the user via the .rea file
\item handling complex geometries that can be imported from external codes 
\end{itemize}
